# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020

During this course you will learn how to build a **meaningful** real-time application. You will learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.

# Party app 
An app where people join a party and we all listen to the same music at the same time. Every person in that party can queue music to the 
party queue. And there is also a way to chat with each other.

For this webapp I'm using the Spotify API. This api lets premium members create playlists, search for songs and add songs 
to playlists. I will be using these functionalities for my product.
